# Rust on Bare Metal  

Welcome to the Rust on Bare Metal training event!

## Getting Started

Unlike most training sessions, it will not be possible to use GitHub Codespaces for this training. Instead, you will need to have a local configured development environment and a Microbit V2 device. Because of the time constraints for this training, it is recommended that you want the presentation then follow-up later with the recording to work through the demonstrations yourself.

A full set of setup instructions have been provided for Linux, Windows, and macOS. Please follow the instructions for your operating system.
